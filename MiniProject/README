README for Mini Project

The pupose of this mini project is to design a control system that regulates the rotational speed of a wheel attached to a motor based using an Arduino and Rasberry Pi, along with a mechanical encoder and camera. An Aruco marker is used to direct the rotation of the wheel. Each quadrant of the Pi camera corresponds to a different angular position of the wheel. Depending on which quadrant that the Aruco marker is detected on the Pi camera, the wheel will rotate to that position on the wheel.
