# Demo 1
The purpose of Demo 1 is to demonstrate a movement and Aruco detection scheme for our robot. With our code, our robot is able to move forward in a straight line for a specified distance (1 to 10 feet), as well as rotate by a specified angle and continue to move forward in a straight line thereafter. Our robot is also able to detect an Aruco marker that is placed infront of it and report the angle to the marker away from the camera center on an LCD screen. 

Our Arduino movement controller code can be found within the "ArduinoCode" folder.

Our Python camera vision code can be found within the "Python Code" folder.
