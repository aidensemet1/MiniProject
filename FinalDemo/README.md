# Final Demo

For our final demo, our robot needs to traverse a specific path that is defined by 6 different Aruco markers. Our robot is designed to traverse the path from 1 to 6 in correct order, come to a stop directly over each marker for at least 5 seconds, and then move on to the next marker. 

Our Arduino movement controller code can be found within the "ArduinoCode" folder.

Our Python camera vision code can be found within the "PythonCode" folder.

Our Simulink models can be found within the "FinalDemo_Simulations" folder.
