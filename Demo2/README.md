# Demo 2

For Demo 2, our robot had to search of an Aruco marker on the ground. Once the camera detected the marker, the distance and angle from the robot to the marker was calculated on the Pi. That information was then sent over to the Arduino, so that the robot could move towards the marker. 

Our Arduino movement controller code can be found within the "ArduinoCode" folder.

Our Python camera vision code can be found within the "PythonCode" folder.

Our Simulink models can be found within the "Demo2_Simulations" folder.
